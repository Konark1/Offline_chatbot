# Offline_chatbot
Offline chatbot
Here’s your complete, end-to-end guide to building an offline chatbot for formulas using GPT4All, running locally on your PC via Python + VS Code. This is all you need to get started with no internet required after setup.

🧱 GOAL
Create an offline chatbot that:

Accepts questions like “What’s the formula for kinetic energy?”

Replies using a local AI model (GPT4All)

Works in Python via VS Code

Can later be expanded with a custom formula database or GUI

✅ STEP 1: Set Up Your Environment
🔹 1.1 Install Prerequisites
[✅] Install Python 3.8+ from python.org

[✅] Install VS Code from code.visualstudio.com

[✅] Install the Python extension in VS Code

✅ STEP 2: Install GPT4All & Model
🔹 2.1 Download GPT4All App
Go to: https://gpt4all.io

Install the app (Windows/macOS/Linux)

🔹 2.2 Download a Model
Inside GPT4All app:

Go to Model Library

Download one of:

✅ mistral-7b-instruct

✅ nous-hermes-llama2-13b

These will be saved to:

Windows: %USERPROFILE%\.gpt4all\

macOS/Linux: ~/.gpt4all/

You don’t need to run the app during usage — just download the model once.

✅ STEP 3: Create Project in VS Code
🔹 3.1 Project Folder Structure
cpp
Copy
Edit
gpt4all-formula-bot/
├── chatbot.py
├── requirements.txt
└── formulas.json      (optional - for later)
✅ STEP 4: Install GPT4All Python Library
Open the VS Code terminal and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install gpt4all
Or put this in requirements.txt:

shell
Copy
Edit
gpt4all>=1.0.0
Then run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
✅ STEP 5: Write Your Chatbot Script
chatbot.py

from gpt4all import GPT4All

def run_chatbot():
    # Use the same model you downloaded
    model = GPT4All("mistral-7b-instruct")  # or "nous-hermes-llama2-13b"
    model.open()

    print("🤖 Formula Bot Ready (offline). Type 'exit' to quit.\n")

    while True:
        question = input("You: ")
        if question.lower() == "exit":
            break

        prompt = f"Give me the formula for {question}."
        response = model.prompt(prompt)
        print("🤖:", response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_chatbot()

Example:
You: area of a circle
🤖: The formula is π × r².

✅ STEP 6: Run Your Offline Chatbot
From the terminal in VS Code:

bash
Copy
Edit
python chatbot.py
You’re now talking to an offline chatbot powered by a local LLM!

✅ STEP 7 (Optional): Add Fallback Formula Database
If you want to respond instantly for known formulas:

formulas.json (sample)
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "area of circle": "π × r²",
  "area of triangle": "½ × base × height",
  "volume of sphere": "(4/3) × π × r³",
  "kinetic energy": "½ × m × v²"
}
Modify Python Code (add before model prompt):
python
Copy
Edit
import json

with open("formulas.json", "r") as f:
    formula_db = json.load(f)

question = input("You: ")
if question.lower() in formula_db:
    print("📘 (from database):", formula_db[question.lower()])
else:
    response = model.prompt(f"Give me the formula for {question}")
    print("🤖:", response)



    
🛠 Optional Improvements You Can Add Later
🔊 Voice input using SpeechRecognition or Whisper

🖼️ GUI with Tkinter, Gradio, or Streamlit

📦 Fine-tune the model with your custom dataset

🌐 Serve as an API using FastAPI or Flask

🔚 You're Done!
You now have:

🧠 A fully offline AI chatbot

💬 Gives smart answers about formulas

🔌 Built with Python + GPT4All

💻 Runs in VS Code
